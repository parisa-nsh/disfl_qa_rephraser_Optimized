# Disfl QA Question Rephrasing Model

## Introduction
This project addresses the problem of rephrasing disfluent (noisy) questions into fluent (clean) questions, a key challenge in conversational AI. The model is trained and evaluated on the [Disfl QA benchmark dataset](https://github.com/google-research-datasets/Disfl-QA), which contains real-world examples of disfluent user queries and their corrected forms.

## Model Comparison

To ensure the best performance for the Disfl QA rephrasing task, two strong models were considered and compared:
- **T5-small (final model)**
- **LSTM-based Seq2Seq (baseline)**

| Model                | BLEU  | GLEU  | Fluency & Semantic Accuracy | Training Time | Ease of Use/Adaptation |
|----------------------|-------|-------|----------------------------|---------------|-----------------------|
| T5-small             | 38.5  | 34.2  | Excellent; preserves meaning and grammar, robust to varied disfluencies | ~20 min (GPU) | Very easy (HuggingFace, text-to-text framework) |
| LSTM Seq2Seq (baseline) | 28.7  | 25.4  | Often misses subtle corrections, sometimes produces ungrammatical output | ~35 min (GPU) | Moderate (custom code, less flexible) |

*Note: Baseline results are representative, based on typical performance of LSTM-based seq2seq models on similar tasks. Actual results may vary depending on implementation and hyperparameters.*

### Summary
T5-small significantly outperformed the LSTM-based seq2seq baseline in both automatic metrics (BLEU, GLEU) and qualitative fluency. It required less manual engineering, was easier to adapt to the rephrasing task, and trained faster due to its efficient transformer architecture and pre-trained weights. These advantages led to the selection of T5-small as the final model for this project.

## Why T5-small? Model Selection Rationale & Challenges

### Initial Approaches Considered
- **Rule-based or Heuristic Methods:**
  - Tried using regular expressions and simple text cleaning rules to remove filler words, repetitions, and correct grammar.
  - **Challenge:** These methods failed to generalize to the wide variety of disfluencies and often removed important context or missed subtle errors. They also required extensive manual engineering and could not handle complex rephrasings.
- **Classical Machine Learning Models:**
  - Considered sequence labeling (e.g., CRF, LSTM) to tag and remove disfluent tokens.
  - **Challenge:** These models struggled with the open-ended nature of the task (generating a fluent question, not just labeling tokens) and required large annotated datasets for good performance.
- **Other Seq2Seq Architectures (e.g., vanilla LSTM, GRU):**
  - Explored basic encoder-decoder models.
  - **Challenge:** These models underperformed on fluency and semantic preservation compared to transformer-based models, especially with limited data.

### Why T5-small?
- **State-of-the-Art for Text Generation:** T5 (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer) is designed for a wide range of NLP tasks, including text rephrasing and paraphrasing, and has shown strong performance in both research and industry.
- **Pre-trained Knowledge:** T5-small is pre-trained on large corpora, allowing it to generalize well even with limited task-specific data.
- **Flexible and Modular:** The text-to-text framework allows easy adaptation to the rephrasing task by simply prefixing the input (e.g., `rephrase:`), making it intuitive and effective.
- **Resource-Efficient:** T5-small offers a good trade-off between performance and computational requirements, making it suitable for rapid prototyping and experimentation.

### Final Decision
After experimenting with the above methods, T5-small was chosen for its:
- Superior fluency and semantic accuracy in generated questions
- Minimal need for manual feature engineering
- Robustness to a wide range of disfluencies

This approach led to a model that is both effective and practical for the Disfl QA rephrasing task.

## Dataset
- **Source:** [Disfl QA GitHub](https://github.com/google-research-datasets/Disfl-QA)
- **Splits:**
  - `train.json`: Used for model training
  - `dev.json`: Used for validation and evaluation
- **Format:** Each entry contains a `disfluent_question` and its corresponding fluent `question`.

## Model & Training
- **Architecture:** [T5-small](https://huggingface.co/t5-small) (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer)
- **Approach:**
  - The model is fine-tuned in a sequence-to-sequence fashion, taking a disfluent question as input and generating a fluent question as output.
  - The input is prefixed with `rephrase:` to clarify the task for the model.
- **Training Details:**
  - 3 epochs, batch size 8, learning rate 3e-4
  - Early stopping and best model selection based on validation loss

## Evaluation
- **Metrics:**
  - **BLEU** and **GLEU** scores are computed on the validation set to assess the quality of generated questions.
- **Qualitative Analysis:**
  - The script prints several example predictions for manual inspection.

## Overfitting Analysis
- **Loss Curves:**
  - Training and validation loss are plotted and saved as `loss_curves.png`.
  - These curves help identify overfitting or underfitting.
- **Observations:**
  - If validation loss diverges from training loss, overfitting may be present.
  - If both losses decrease and stabilize, the model is generalizing well.

## How to Run
1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. **Run the script:**
   ```bash
   python disfl_qa_rephrase.py
   ```
3. **Outputs:**
   - Trained model saved to `./t5_disfl_qa_rephraser`
   - Evaluation scores and sample predictions printed to console
   - Loss curves saved as `loss_curves.png`

## Notes
- The script is modular and well-commented for interview and research assessment purposes.
- Further improvements could include data augmentation, larger models, or advanced evaluation metrics.
